# Basic Concepts

## Computer-Aided Design

Computer-aided design(in an abbreviated term : CAD) is widely used in  research areas.

CAD techniques developed through 1980s, and it is still widely used in industry.

## 3D Representations in CAD

There are mainly three methods to sample from raw images and render into 3D computer graphic model. First, 3D objects can be represented into multiple points called **point cloud**. Although it is simple to visualize, its absence of topological information yields significant drawbacks in 3D rendering. Second, mesh (needs to be filled) Third, voxel (needs to be filled)

Our research focuses on point cloud representations.

# What is NURBS, and what is it used for?

NURBS stands for Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline. 

Since the theoretical concept of NURBS has emerged in 1970s, it has b CAD. NURBS is an to 구현 3D images. Rhinoceros is an exemplary CAD software supported by NURBS as its fundamental technology.
